MATRIX OF dN/ds

i think i can do it with a bunch of chromosome 3 segments, since the cluster appears there. ive really been doing this in an incredible ineffective fashion havent I.
I can reuse the query seq. from the prior to find the CDS. another run is good for refining the approach anyway.

before even isolating the gene snippets it is worth noting that this gene cluster is REALLY conserved within species, like the ID is 100% across 29 random species. i had 30 but that strain just didnt turn up im not going to think about that too much!
need a script that turns blast tsv into BED and GFF im tiredd of juggling scripts.

TRYING PRANK FOR THE CODON AWARE ALIGNMENT!!!!

it would appear for both sets, i didnt check the scaffolds being used.
i should check the scaffolds for the third run.
yea im assuming theres some reference bias going on or something this doesnt make sense?
i think the way to check is looking at the assembler used?
yeah i have to look at the assembler thats important, some of them ARE ref guided, and its the only way to tell if its NOT from a published paper.
IT OUTRIGHT STATED IT WAS REFERENCE GUIDED AHHHH
GRAB GENOMES THAT ARENT REF GUIDED AND DO THE PROCESS AGAIN. SPECIFICALLY CHROM 3 YOU KNOW THE DRILL
NO BUT WHY ARE THESE REGIONS ALWAYS THE SAME WHAT
