MATRIX OF dN/ds

i think i can do it with a bunch of chromosome 3 segments, since the cluster appears there. ive really been doing this in an incredible ineffective fashion havent I.
I can reuse the query seq. from the prior to find the CDS. another run is good for refining the approach anyway.

before even isolating the gene snippets it is worth noting that this gene cluster is REALLY conserved within species, like the ID is 100% across 29 random species. i had 30 but that strain just didnt turn up im not going to think about that too much!
need a script that turns blast tsv into BED and GFF im tiredd of juggling scripts.
