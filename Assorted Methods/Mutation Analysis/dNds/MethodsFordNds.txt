blastn -query CAQuery.fasta -db CAblastDB \
  -outfmt "6 qseqid sseqid pident length qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore" \
  -out CA_hits.tsv

put this output into BEDinator.py
(this takes the smallest start and the largest endpoint and adds some padding thus giving the entire cluster)
then put bed file from THAT into the following.

bedtools getfasta -fi <COMBINED GENOME FASTA> -bed <BED OUTPUT> -fo <FASTA CLUSTER OUTPUT>

You can split the output using the SPLITinator, it generates some kinda weirdly named files, you'll need to rename them. "for f in *.fasta; do mv "$f" "${f//:/_}"; done" in bash should do the trick.
