GET YOUR GENOMES, LEAVE THE NAMES
CONVERT THEM TO A BLAST DATABASE USING NCBI BLAST+
BLAST THEM, STANDARD OUTFMT6 SAVE OUTPUT AS TSV
USE ANNOTATE-INATOR TO CONVERT TO GFF
TRIM DOWN GENOME NAMES TO JUST BE THE ACCESSION. (for fasta in *.fasta; do
  sed -i 's/^>\([^:]*\):.*/>\1/' "$fasta"
done)
THEN YOU HAVE A GFF!!
