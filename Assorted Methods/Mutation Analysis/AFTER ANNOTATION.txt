cat *.fasta > combinedSnip.fasta


gotta fix the gff first
awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"} !/^#/ {$1=gensub(/:.*/, "", "g", $1)} 1' annotations.gff > fixed.gff


THIS BIT WORKED
awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"} !/^#/ {print $1, $4-1, $5, $9, ".", $7}' fixed.gff > regions.bed
bedtools getfasta -fi combinedSnip.fasta -bed regions.bed -s -name > extracted_genes.fasta

this is the stuff i did after i got the sorta-ok gff file to then extract the coding sequences.

we then just throw those extracted genes into mafft to get a protein alignment!
THEN we can use that with pal2nal to get the results!!!!!!! FINALLY!!
