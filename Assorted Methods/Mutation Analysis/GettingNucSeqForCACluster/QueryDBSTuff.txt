makeblastdb -in CAchrom3.fasta -dbtype nucl -out nucleotide_db

a lot of stuff was manually renamed to get this to work, original accession was CP157510.1, chromosome 3, this was found through BLASTing the MP cluster through NCBI blast's webserver.	

you have to rename the used chromosomes to have short, simple names otherwise bash dislikes it.

need to make it a DB first, blast is very annoying, then use tblasn, pick queries from that.

i manually wrote these to then extract the hit regions as fasta files, theres probably a better way-- however i did not opt to do it.
